## **1. Introduction**
Welcome to the **OKE Landing Zone Extension**.

The OKE Landing Zone Extension is a secure cloud environment, designed with best practices to simplify the on-boarding of OKE workloads and enable the continuous operations of their cloud resources. This reference architecture provides an automated landing zone configuration.
&nbsp;

## **2. Design Overview**
This workload extension uses the [One-OE](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe) Blueprint as the reference Landing Zone and guides the deployment of OKE on top of it.
&nbsp;

## **3. Deployment**

These are the required steps to provision the OKE landing zone extension:

 1. The [One-OE](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe) LZ is a requirement and needs to be deployed before continuing, in this example we are choosing One-Stack Deployment with CIS Level 1 Security Controls + Hub model A (no cost version). Any other OCI landing zone, such as a [CIS landing zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart), [OCI Core Landing Zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/terraform-oci-core-landingzone) or [Multi-OE](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/multi-oe/generic_v1/runtime), can be deployed as a baseline landing zone but maybe be required some minor customizations.
 2. Deploy the **foundation infrastructure**. Follow the guide in [Step 1](/1_foundation/)
 3. Create **OKE clusters** in [Step 2](2_oke/)
